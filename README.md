# LearnOs

Welcome to the **LearnOs** GitHub repository! This repository contains a simple Python project that demonstrates the basics of an operating system simulation. The project provides an `os_t` class, a simple operating system class that can handle various system functions, and a `Process` class for managing processes.

## Overview

The `os_t` class is designed to simulate an operating system environment. It provides methods for handling system interrupts, managing input/output, handling keyboard inputs, and managing processes.

The `Process` class represents a process in the simulated operating system. It includes information such as process ID, state, memory space, program, and file descriptors.
