## Overview 🌟

The `os_t` class is designed to simulate an operating system environment. It provides methods for handling system interrupts, managing input/output, handling keyboard inputs, and managing processes.

The `Process` class represents a process in the simulated operating system. It includes information such as process ID, state, memory space, program, and file descriptors.
